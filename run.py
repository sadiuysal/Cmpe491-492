"""# TensorFlow 2 quickstart for beginners

This short introduction uses [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) to:

1. Build a neural network that classifies images.
2. Train this neural network.
3. And, finally, evaluate the accuracy of the model.

This is a [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) notebook file. Python programs are run directly in the browserâ€”a great way to learn and use TensorFlow. To follow this tutorial, run the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the button at the top of this page.

1. In Colab, connect to a Python runtime: At the top-right of the menu bar, select *CONNECT*.
2. Run all the notebook code cells: Select *Runtime* > *Run all*.

Download and install TensorFlow 2. Import TensorFlow into your program:

Note: Upgrade `pip` to install the TensorFlow 2 package. See the [install guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) for details.
